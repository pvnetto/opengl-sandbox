# SPIR-V

- SPIR-V is an intermediate language for shaders;
- It can be generated from higher level languages, like GLSL;
- OpenGL also accepts shaders in SPIR-V;

### Generating SPIR-V shaders

You can either:
- a) Convert them at runtime on your C++ program;
- b) Use the SPIR-V tool chain to generate them offline from GLSL shaders;

### Advantages
- Portability for SPIR-V is better than high-level languages because it's stricter;
- Allows you to use other shading languages, instead of just GLSL;
- Reduced distribution size;
